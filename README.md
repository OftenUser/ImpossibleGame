# ImpossibleGame
This game was programmed by me in March of 2017. I did not know about Github back then, hence the lack of commits, but I
decided to upload it just in case I decide to make changes to it in the future or something. I will give a brief overview
of how I created it and how to install and play it if you would like.

# Creation 
I coded this game froms scratch in Eclipse. I used Java Swing and Awt to do the GUI and everything. I just used Java's
built-in methods to retrieve user input. I used some collision detection functions that I had read about in
a book about HTMl and Javascript game design.

To design the levels I used Tiled. It is basically just a way to drag sprites onto an image and it assigns them numbers for
each tile. I then used a giant 2D array to store each of the levels, then when the game is started it simply calls the
array that it needs to build the level.

It builds each level using a big switch statement and a sprite sheet. The main menu and level selection are pretty simple 
GUI creations and that's how I built the game.

# Download
If you would like to play my game there's an article at this [link](http://ambrosiogabe.github.io/install-the-impossible-game/)
on how to download it and play it. I really hope you give it a try :)

# Copyright
By the way, this game was NOT my idea. I took this idea directly from The World's Hardest Game. Please note I have no idea
how they coded that, all the code here is my own and this creation is entirely my own. I am licensing this under the 
MIT copyright free license. So feel free to check this out and try and recreate it for yourself.
